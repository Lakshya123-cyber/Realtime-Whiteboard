# Realtime-Whiteboard
This is a realtime collaborative whiteboard I made just to get an idea of the Node servers.
I am not uploading the node_modules folder becuase it won't work unless you download it from your end.

To download that you need to first install Node.js from their website and then run the command on you terminal which is:
->npm init -y

And then you need to download certain modules for the node.js inorder to run the server

The modules installation process is as follows:
-> npm i express socket.io

After all of that, you can change the test command by downloading nodemon
-> npm i -D nodemon

To run the server:
-> npm run dev

Your whiteboard will be running on the default port.
